## **About the Project**

The **Coding Resources Web App** is created to assist students and aspiring developers in accessing key resources for learning programming languages. By selecting a language icon, users are navigated to a dedicated page containing curated YouTube tutorials and notes to reinforce their understanding.

This web app aims to simplify the learning process for beginners, making it easy for them to access video tutorials and notes without navigating multiple platforms.

## **Features**

- **Intuitive Navigation**: Easily explore resources for different programming languages through clickable icons.
- **Typing Animation**: The main title of the app cycles through programming language names with a smooth typing animation.
- **Language-Specific Resource Pages**: Each language has its dedicated page with video tutorials and learning notes.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on various devices including mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- **Interactive Elements**: Logos animate when hovered, improving the overall user experience.

## **Technologies Used**

- **HTML5**: For structuring the content and layout of the web pages.
- **CSS3**: For styling, animations, and ensuring a responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactive elements, handling animations (such as the typing effect), and managing page transitions.

## **Getting Started**

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### **Prerequisites**

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
- A local server like [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) (optional but recommended for testing).

### **Installation**

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/coding-resources-webapp.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**  
   ```bash
   cd coding-resources-webapp
   ```

3. **Open the Project**  
   - If using a code editor like VSCode, simply open the `index.html` file in your browser.
   - Alternatively, run a local server using Live Server in your editor to view the project.

## **Usage**

1. Launch the web app by opening the `index.html` file.
2. On the homepage, you’ll find logos of five programming languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and C.
3. Click on any logo to open a page that provides:
   - A curated YouTube video tutorial for the selected language.
   - Notes section below the video for additional resources or explanations.
4. Return to the homepage anytime by navigating back or clicking the browser’s back button.

## **Project Structure**

The project is organized into several folders and files to maintain structure and clarity.

```bash
coding-resources-webapp/
